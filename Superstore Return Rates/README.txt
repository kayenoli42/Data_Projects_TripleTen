[Linnk to Tableau] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patrice.daley/viz/Sprint5Project_17640085671660/Story?publish=yes)
In this project, I analyzed order and return data to understand what drives product returns. Using Tableau, I joined order and return datasets, created calculated fields to measure return rates, and built multiple visualizations including scatterplots, bar charts, maps, and time based analyses. I examined returns by product category, customer behavior, geographic region, seasonality, and sales volume, then brought these insights together into an interactive dashboard designed to help stakeholders track return trends, identify high risk areas, and support data-driven decisions to reduce return
