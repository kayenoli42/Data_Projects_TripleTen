In this project, I used SQL to analyze a comprehensive startup and investment database to understand trends across the startup ecosystem. The analysis included evaluating startup success rates, sector-specific funding patterns, cash-based acquisition activity, geographic investment distribution, and funding round volatility. I also classified venture funds by activity level, examined investment strategies across fund types, and explored whether employee education levels correlate with startup success. These insights support data-driven decision-making for investors, marketing teams, and risk analysts.
