In this project, I developed a business intelligence report for Fresh Beats, a music streaming and artist promotion platform. Using provided datasets, insights, and visualizations, I analyzed key business challenges including artist promotion effectiveness, user engagement and conversion, and genre-based promotion for emerging artists. I connected data insights to business needs and delivered clear, actionable recommendations in a stakeholder-friendly report format to support platform growth and improved performance.
