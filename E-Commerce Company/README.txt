In this project, I analyzed raw e-commerce transaction and user activity data to understand how customers interact with an online store. I built a conversion funnel to measure how effectively product page views convert into purchases, then prepared and transformed purchase data to create monthly acquisition cohorts. Using pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and date-based calculations, I calculated cohort retention rates to track customer behavior over time and identify trends that could inform improvements to the user journey and customer retention strategies.
